# Nexus Clash Interface Tweaks
A userscript that tweaks the Nexus Clash user interface to be bearable

# Usage
Install the userscript via GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey.
Then navigate to your character's "Pad" tab in the multifunction pane.
There are two types of modules: "local" for character-specific settings, and "global" for all characters (for instance, Global Message History).
You can enable modules by clicking the checkbox beneath the character pad for the relevant module.
Each module may also have optional settings associated with it, which will be displayed alongside the enable/disable checkbox.


# Features
## Global Message History
A global module that stylises the message log (both in-game and in the week log).
This massively improves readability of the game, but is not tested to be colour-blind friendly.
